# countplot

## Description

Makes a bar plot of all categorical features to show their counts.

```python
countplot(data=None, 
          features=None, 
          separate_by=None, 
          fig_size=(5,5), 
          save_fig=False):

   '''
    Parameters
    ------------
        data : DataFrame, array, or list of arrays.

            The data to plot.

        features: str, scalar, array, or list. 

            The categorical features in the dataset, if not provided, 
            we try to infer the categorical columns from the dataframe.

        separate_by: str, default None.

            The feature used to seperate the plot. Called hue in seaborn.

        fig_size: tuple, Default (5,5)

            The size of the figure object.

        save_fig: bool, Default False.

            Saves the plot to the current working directory

 '''
```

## Examples

We are using the titanic data set and a Jupyter notebook in the following examples.

Countplot can be created for every categorical column in a DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
import datasist.visualizations as vs

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
vs.countplot(data=df)
```
